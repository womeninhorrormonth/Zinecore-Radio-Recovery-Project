# Zinecore-Radio-Recovery-Project
Do you have any old downloads from The Zinecore Radio Show or a means of contacting BlogTalkRadio? The old email account associated with the show no longer exists and i've been trying for years with no luck. I am the creator and host and will make an entry for each lost episode and any sound or visuals i've found but it's mostly all lost.
